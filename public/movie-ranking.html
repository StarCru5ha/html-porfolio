<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard</h3>
<p>The reason this movie is on the top of my list is because it is not only action packed but it's filled with comedy scenes as wll through the whole movie. Its stars one of my favorit actors Ryan Reynolds.</p>

<h3>IPMAN 4</h3>
<p>This is great movie about Kung Fu and has a bit of drama.</p>

<h3>Shooter</h3>
<p>Great movie about a ex sniper who is framed by government officials who claimed they needed his help protecting the president. This a great pic because it is filled with tactical and technical information on how to operate a sniper rifle.</p>
